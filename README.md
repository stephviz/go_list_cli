# GO CLI

Hello and welcome!

Test project and first Golang code I've ever written!

## Running the project
* make sure you have Go installed. This project runs on version 1.19
* Grab `list.go` and make sure you run the following commands from its parent folder
* run `go run .` with list items following eg `go run . snacks bananas oatmilk`
* you can add a `--numbered` flag to show a numbered list eg `go run . --numbered snacks bananas oatmilk`
